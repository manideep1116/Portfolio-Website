# Portfolio-Website

This is my personal portfolio website. It includes details about my
experience, skills, and projects.


This static website serves over HTTPS using AWS S3 and Cloudfront distribution which cache the content at various edge locations(data centers).
When a user requests content that we are serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the nearest edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

You can access the website [here](http://www.manideepreddy.com).
